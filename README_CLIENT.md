Client notes:
- This is a minimal React app using react-scripts.
- For Word to load content from https://localhost:3000 you may need to run the dev server in HTTPS mode:
  On macOS/Linux:
    HTTPS=true npm start
  On Windows PowerShell:
    $env:HTTPS='true'; npm start
- Alternatively use `npm run build` and serve the build folder with a local HTTPS server.
